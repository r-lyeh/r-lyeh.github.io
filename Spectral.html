Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator from the 80s.

Spectral is an experimental Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator from the 80s, which has been randomly assembled [since the pandemic days](https://twitter.com/r_rlyeh/status/1280964279903158273). Accuracy and performance are long-term goals, but the primary focus is just having fun with this thing. Hardcore ZX users will find little value in this emulator right now, but I hope newbies may find its ease of use somehow appealing to try.
That being said, Spectral has a very compatible TAP/TZX loader and some other interesting features that provide me some fun in these days.
Code is highly experimental and prone to change in the future. I will keep altering/breaking things randomly for good sake.

# Downloads
Download both source code and binary releases from [these links](https://github.com/r-lyeh/Spectral/releases).

Alternatively, you can build the emulator yourself:
- Windows users double click `MAKE.bat` file.
- Linux/MacOS users can run `sh MAKE.bat` instead.

# Usage
Spectral can be configured with a mouse.

Here are some keyboard shortcuts, though:
- ESC: Game browser
- ALT+ENTER: Fullscreen
- TAB+CURSORS (or GAMEPAD): Joystick

Hold any F1..F12 key for 2 seconds to redefine it.
